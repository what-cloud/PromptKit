# Protocol: Layout Design Review

Apply this protocol when reviewing a PCB layout (KiCad .kicad_pcb,
DRC reports, or layout description) against the schematic intent and
requirements. Execute all phases in order.

## Phase 1: DRC Report Review

If DRC output is provided, review it first.

1. **Violations vs. warnings**: Classify each DRC item:
   - Violations (errors) → must be resolved before manufacturing
   - Warnings → assess whether each is acceptable or needs fixing

2. **For each violation**, assess:
   - Is it a real design error or a DRC rule misconfiguration?
   - What is the impact if it goes to manufacturing unfixed?

3. **DRC rule coverage**: Are the DRC rules appropriate for the
   target fabrication house? (e.g., JLCPCB minimum trace width
   vs. OSH Park minimum trace width)

## Phase 2: Trace Width and Current Capacity

Verify that trace widths are adequate for the current they carry.

1. **Power traces**: For every trace carrying power (VIN, VBAT, 3V3,
   5V, VBUS):
   - Calculate required trace width for the worst-case current using
     IPC-2221 or equivalent (accounting for copper weight, temperature
     rise, and layer)
   - Compare to actual trace width
   - Flag undersized traces

2. **Signal traces**: Verify signal traces meet minimum width for
   the fabrication house's capabilities.

3. **Ground connections**: Verify ground traces/vias are adequate
   for return current paths, especially for high-current loads.

## Phase 3: Impedance and Signal Integrity

For high-speed or impedance-sensitive signals, verify routing.

1. **USB differential pairs**: D+ and D- should be:
   - Routed as a tightly coupled differential pair
   - Length-matched within the spec's tolerance
   - Target impedance documented (typically ~90Ω differential for USB 2.0 high-speed; verify mode-specific requirements and stackup)
   - Reference plane continuous under the pair

2. **Other controlled-impedance traces**: If the design requires
   controlled impedance (RF, Ethernet, high-speed SPI), verify
   the stackup and trace geometry support the target impedance.

3. **Return path continuity**: For signals crossing between layers,
   verify via placement provides a return current path near the
   signal via. Slots or gaps in the ground plane under signal
   traces are findings.

## Phase 4: Component Placement Review

Verify placement follows design intent and best practices.

1. **Decoupling capacitor placement**: For each IC:
   - Is the decoupling cap within 3mm of the power pin?
   - Is the via to ground close to the cap (not routed through a
     long trace)?
   - **Layout carry-forward from schematic review**: verify all
     schematic-flagged placement constraints are satisfied

2. **Antenna keepout**: If the design has an antenna (PCB antenna,
   U.FL connector):
   - Verify no copper (traces, pours, components) in the keepout zone
   - Verify ground plane clearance per the module datasheet

3. **Connector placement**: Verify connectors are accessible from
   board edges and oriented correctly for the enclosure (if specified).

4. **Thermal placement**: Components with significant power dissipation
   should have adequate thermal relief:
   - Thermal vias under exposed pads
   - Copper pour for heat spreading where needed
   - Not placed adjacent to temperature-sensitive components

## Phase 5: Ground Plane and Power Integrity

Verify the ground and power plane design.

1. **Ground plane continuity**: The ground plane should be continuous
   under signal routing areas:
   - Flag slots, cutouts, or narrow necks in the ground plane
   - Especially critical under high-speed signals and near connectors

2. **Power plane/pour integrity**: Power pours should provide low-
   impedance paths from regulator output to loads:
   - Flag narrow necks or long routing paths in power pours
   - Verify power pour connections are adequate (multiple vias, not
     single thin trace)

3. **Star grounding / ground domains**: If the design has separate
   analog and digital ground domains, verify they are properly
   separated and joined at a single point.

## Phase 6: Manufacturing Constraint Compliance

Verify the layout meets the target fabrication house's capabilities.

1. **Minimum features**: Verify all features meet the fab's minimums:
   - Trace width and spacing
   - Via drill and annular ring
   - Solder mask dam between pads
   - Silkscreen line width and clearance from pads

2. **Board outline**: Verify board dimensions, corner radii, and
   cutouts are within fab capabilities.

3. **Panelization**: If the design will be panelized, verify
   sufficient edge clearance for V-scoring or tab routing.

4. **Assembly constraints**: For SMT assembly:
   - Component orientation consistent (pin 1 indicators, polarity)
   - Adequate spacing between components for pick-and-place
   - Fiducial markers present if required by the assembly house

## Phase 7: Findings Summary

Compile findings from all phases.

1. **For each finding**, document:
   - Phase that discovered it (use exact phase label, e.g.,
     "Phase 2: Trace Width and Current Capacity")
   - Affected component(s), trace(s), or board area
   - Severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational)
   - Remediation: layout fix required vs. acceptable with
     justification vs. DRC rule adjustment needed

2. **Produce a layout review coverage summary**:
   - DRC items reviewed / total
   - Power traces checked / total power nets
   - Controlled impedance signals verified / total
   - Manufacturing constraints checked against target fab
