# Protocol: Prompt Portability Evaluation

Apply this protocol when evaluating whether a prompt produces
semantically equivalent outputs across different LLM models. The unit
of comparison is the **claim** — an atomic assertion the output makes —
not the raw text. Two outputs that say the same thing in different words
are equivalent; two outputs with identical structure but different
conclusions are divergent.

## Phase 1: Output Collection

1. **Validate inputs.** Confirm the assembled prompt is non-empty and
   the golden input is non-empty. If either is missing, stop and report
   the error.
2. **Enumerate target models.** List the models to evaluate. If the
   user did not provide a list, use the default set:
   `claude-sonnet-4.5`, `gpt-4.1`, `claude-haiku-4.5`.
3. **Execute the prompt against each model.** For each model:
   - Provide the identical assembled prompt and golden input.
   - Use the same system context and tool availability where possible.
   - Record the model identifier and the complete raw output.
4. **Launch evaluations in parallel** when the execution environment
   supports it (e.g., parallel sub-agents with model overrides). Do NOT
   run models sequentially if parallel execution is available.

## Phase 2: Claim Extraction

For each model's raw output, extract a set of **atomic claims**. A claim
is a single, self-contained assertion that the output makes. Apply the
same extraction procedure identically to every output.

1. **Read the output end-to-end.** Identify every discrete assertion,
   finding, recommendation, observation, or caveat.
2. **Normalize each claim** into a structured record:

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | `claim_id` | Sequential ID within this model's output (e.g., `M1-C001`) |
   | `claim_text` | The normalized assertion in declarative form |
   | `section` | Which output section contains this claim |
   | `type` | `finding` · `recommendation` · `observation` · `caveat` · `classification` |
   | `specificity` | `concrete` (cites evidence/location) · `general` (abstract statement) |

3. **Granularity rule.** Each claim must be atomic — it asserts exactly
   one thing. If a sentence contains two assertions ("X is true and Y
   is also true"), split into two claims.
4. **Extraction exclusions.** Do NOT extract:
   - Boilerplate preambles ("I'll analyze this code for…")
   - Section headings or structural markers
   - Restatements of the input prompt or golden input
   - Meta-commentary about the model's own process

## Phase 3: Cross-Model Claim Matching

Compare claim sets across all models to identify semantic equivalences.

1. **Build a claim universe.** Collect all claims from all models into
   a single pool.
2. **Pairwise semantic matching.** For each claim from model A, check
   every claim from every other model:
   - **Match**: The two claims assert the same thing, even if worded
     differently. Evidence: they would have the same truth value in all
     plausible interpretations of the golden input.
   - **Partial match**: The claims overlap but one is more specific or
     covers a subset of the other's assertion.
   - **No match**: The claims assert different things.
   - **Contradiction**: The claims assert mutually exclusive things
     about the same subject.
3. **Cluster matched claims.** Group semantically equivalent claims
   into **claim clusters**. Each cluster represents one unique
   assertion that one or more models made.
4. **Record match confidence.** For each match decision, note the
   confidence: `definite` (identical meaning), `likely` (same meaning,
   different framing), `uncertain` (possibly the same, possibly
   different).

## Phase 4: Consensus Classification

Classify each claim cluster by how many models produced it.

| Classification | Criterion | Interpretation |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Consensus** | All models produced this claim | Semantically stable — the prompt reliably elicits this assertion |
| **Majority** | >50% of models (but not all) produced this claim | Likely valid but not universally elicited — prompt may be ambiguous |
| **Singular** | Exactly one model produced this claim | Possible hallucination, unique insight, or model-specific interpretation |
| **Contradictory** | Two or more models assert mutually exclusive things | The prompt is ambiguous on this point — different models resolve the ambiguity differently |

Rules:
- A claim cluster with any `uncertain` match must be placed in a
  **Manual Review** bucket rather than auto-classified as Consensus,
  Majority, Singular, or Contradictory.
- Manual Review clusters are **excluded from the portability score**
  until a human reviewer resolves the uncertain match and assigns the
  cluster to a standard classification.
- Report Manual Review clusters in a separate portability report
  section named **Uncertain / Needs Review**. Do not include them under
  the standard classification counts until they are resolved.
- Singular claims from high-capability models are not automatically
  hallucinations — they may represent deeper analysis that other models
  missed. Note the model capability tier.
- Contradictory claims are the highest-priority signal. Always trace
  these to specific prompt language in Phase 5.

## Phase 5: Divergence Root Cause Analysis

For each Singular or Contradictory claim cluster:

1. **Identify the prompt region** that the claim responds to. Which
   instruction, protocol phase, or format requirement produced this
   claim?
2. **Analyze the prompt language.** What about the instruction is
   ambiguous, underspecified, or open to interpretation?
   - Vague quantifiers ("several", "a few")
   - Subjective adjectives ("important", "significant")
   - Missing scope bounds ("analyze the code" — which code?)
   - Implicit assumptions (domain knowledge the prompt assumes)
   - Competing instructions (two directives that could conflict)
3. **Classify the divergence cause:**

   | Cause | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | `ambiguous-instruction` | The prompt instruction has multiple valid interpretations |
   | `underspecified-scope` | The prompt does not bound what to examine or how deeply |
   | `model-capability-gap` | One model lacks the capability to follow the instruction |
   | `hallucination` | One model fabricated a claim with no basis in the input |
   | `depth-variation` | Models analyzed to different depths — all are correct, but some are more thorough |
   | `format-interpretation` | Models interpreted the output format requirements differently |

## Phase 6: Portability Scoring

Compute a portability score for the evaluated prompt.

1. **Claim-level scoring.** For each claim cluster:
   - Consensus = 1.0
   - Majority = 0.5
   - Singular = 0.0
   - Contradictory = −1.0

   **Canonical cluster type rule.** When claims in a cluster were
   assigned different types across models (e.g., one model calls it a
   `finding`, another calls it a `recommendation`), assign the cluster
   the type with the **highest weight** among its member claims. If
   two types share the same weight, prefer the type that appears in
   the majority of member claims. If still tied, the arbiter assigns
   the canonical type. Record the original per-model types in the
   claim cluster details for transparency.

2. **Aggregate score.** First compute the weighted mean of all claim
   cluster scores, weighted by claim type priority:
   - `finding` weight = 3 (findings that differ are high-impact)
   - `recommendation` weight = 2
   - `classification` weight = 2
   - `observation` weight = 1
   - `caveat` weight = 1

   Then normalize the weighted mean from the `[-1.0, 1.0]` range into
   the final portability score in the `[0.0, 1.0]` range using:

   `portability_score = (raw_weighted_mean + 1.0) / 2.0`

   This preserves the stronger penalty for contradictory claims while
   ensuring the reported portability score cannot be negative or exceed
   `1.0`.

3. **Interpret the score:**

   | Score Range | Rating | Interpretation |
   |-------------|--------|----------------|
   | ≥ 0.85 | **Portable** | Prompt produces semantically equivalent output across models |
   | 0.60–0.84 | **Mostly Portable** | Core findings are stable; peripheral claims vary |
   | 0.35–0.59 | **Fragile** | Significant divergence — prompt hardening needed |
   | < 0.35 | **Model-Dependent** | Output varies substantially — prompt needs major revision |

## Phase 7: Hardening Recommendations

For each Singular or Contradictory claim cluster, propose a specific
prompt rewrite that would move the claim toward Consensus.

1. **State the current prompt language** (exact quote).
2. **Explain why it produces divergence** (from Phase 5 analysis).
3. **Propose a rewrite** that eliminates the ambiguity. The rewrite
   must be concrete — not "make this more specific" but the actual
   replacement text.
4. **Predict the effect** — which models would change behavior and why.

Rules:
- Rewrites must not change the prompt's intent — only its precision.
- Rewrites must follow PromptKit conventions (imperative mood, numbered
  phases, explicit scope bounds).
- If a divergence is caused by `model-capability-gap`, note that no
  prompt rewrite can fix it. Instead recommend a `model_notes` entry.

## Phase 8: Model Sufficiency Analysis (Reference Model Mode)

This phase executes only when a **reference model** is designated. Skip
this phase entirely if no reference model is specified.

When a reference model is designated, its claim set becomes the
**baseline** — the ground truth against which all other models are
measured. This shifts the analysis from "do models agree?" (consensus)
to "does model X reproduce the reference model's output?" (sufficiency).

1. **Designate the baseline claim set.** The reference model's
   extracted claims from Phase 2 become the baseline. Every claim in
   the baseline is a **required claim**.

2. **Per-model sufficiency scoring.** For each non-reference model,
   compute:

   | Metric | Definition |
   |--------|------------|
   | **Reproduced** | Claims from the baseline that this model also produced (matched in Phase 3) |
   | **Missing** | Claims from the baseline that this model did NOT produce |
   | **Extra** | Claims this model produced that are NOT in the baseline |
   | **Contradicted** | Claims where this model asserts the opposite of the baseline |
   | **Sufficiency Rate** | `reproduced / total_baseline_claims × 100%` |

3. **Classify missing claims by impact.** For each missing claim,
   assess its importance:
   - **Critical miss**: A finding or recommendation that, if absent,
     would leave a significant gap (e.g., missing a security
     vulnerability the reference model found)
   - **Minor miss**: An observation or caveat whose absence does not
     meaningfully degrade the output

4. **Classify extra claims.** For each claim the model produced that
   the reference did not:
   - **Valid addition**: A correct claim the reference model missed
     (depth-variation in the model's favor)
   - **Hallucination**: A claim with no basis in the input
   - **Noise**: A low-value observation that adds length without
     insight

5. **Determine sufficiency.** A model is **sufficient** for this
   prompt if:
   - Sufficiency rate meets or exceeds the user-specified threshold
     (default: 90%)
   - Zero critical misses
   - Zero contradicted claims

   A model is **conditionally sufficient** if:
   - Sufficiency rate meets the threshold
   - Has critical misses, but all are traceable to a
     `model-capability-gap` divergence cause (the model cannot be
     fixed by prompt hardening)

   A model is **insufficient** if it fails either criterion.

6. **Produce the model sufficiency matrix.** Rank models by cost tier
   (if known) and sufficiency rate. The **minimum sufficient model**
   is the cheapest model that meets the sufficiency threshold with
   zero critical misses and zero contradictions.
