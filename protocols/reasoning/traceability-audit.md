# Protocol: Traceability Audit

Apply this protocol when auditing a set of specification documents
(requirements, design, validation plan) for consistency, completeness,
and traceability. The goal is to find every gap, conflict, and
unjustified assumption across the document set — not to confirm adequacy.

## Phase 1: Artifact Inventory

Before comparing documents, extract a complete inventory of traceable
items from each document provided.

1. **Requirements document** — extract:
   - Every REQ-ID (e.g., REQ-AUTH-001) with its category and summary
   - Every acceptance criterion linked to each REQ-ID
   - Every assumption (ASM-NNN) and constraint (CON-NNN)
   - Every dependency (DEP-NNN)
   - Defined terms and glossary entries

2. **Design document** (if provided) — extract:
   - Every component, interface, and module described
   - Every explicit REQ-ID reference in design sections
   - Every design decision and its stated rationale
   - Every assumption stated or implied in the design
   - Non-functional approach (performance strategy, security approach, etc.)

3. **Validation plan** — extract:
   - Every test case ID (TC-NNN) with its linked REQ-ID(s)
   - The traceability matrix (REQ-ID → TC-NNN mappings)
   - Test levels (unit, integration, system, etc.)
   - Pass/fail criteria for each test case
   - Environmental assumptions for test execution

**Output**: A structured inventory for each document. If a document is
not provided, note its absence and skip its inventory — do NOT invent
content for the missing document.

4. **Supplementary specifications** (if provided) — extract:
   - Key definitions, constraints, or invariants that requirements
     reference
   - Identifiers or section numbers that the core documents cite
   - Assumptions that bear on the requirements or design

5. **External reference check** — scan the provided documents
   (requirements, design, validation plan) for references to
   external specifications (by name, URL, or document ID) that are not
   included in the provided document set. If the design document is NOT
   provided, note this limitation in the coverage summary and skip
   design-specific external references. Record each missing reference
   so it can be reported in the coverage summary. This catches the case
   where a component's full specification surface is larger than the
   provided trifecta.

## Phase 2: Forward Traceability (Requirements → Downstream)

Check that every requirement flows forward into downstream documents.

1. **Requirements → Design** (skip if no design document):
   - For each REQ-ID, search the design document for explicit references
     or sections that address the requirement's specified behavior.
   - A design section *mentioning* a requirement keyword is NOT sufficient.
     The section must identify the specific architectural component(s) and
     explain the mechanism by which each implements the requirement.
   - Record: REQ-ID → design section(s), or mark as UNTRACED.

2. **Requirements → Validation**:
   - For each REQ-ID, check the traceability matrix for linked test cases.
   - If the traceability matrix is absent or incomplete, search test case
     descriptions for REQ-ID references.
   - Record: REQ-ID → TC-NNN(s), or mark as UNTESTED.

3. **Acceptance Criteria → Test Cases**:
   - For each requirement that IS linked to a test case, verify that the
     test case's steps and expected results actually exercise the
     requirement's acceptance criteria. Perform the following sub-checks:

   a. **Criterion-level coverage**: If a requirement has multiple
      acceptance criteria (AC1, AC2, AC3…), verify that the linked test
      case(s) collectively cover ALL of them — not just the first or
      most obvious one. A test that covers AC1 but ignores AC2 and AC3
      is a D7 finding.

   b. **Negative case coverage**: If the requirement uses prohibition
      language (MUST NOT, SHALL NOT), verify that at least one test
      asserts the prohibited behavior does NOT occur. A test that only
      verifies the positive path without asserting the absence of the
      prohibited behavior is a D7 finding.

   c. **Boundary and threshold verification**: If the requirement
      specifies a quantitative threshold (e.g., "within 200ms", "at
      most 1000 connections", "no more than 3 retries"), verify that the
      test exercises the boundary — not just a value well within the
      limit. A test that checks "responds in 50ms" does not verify a
      "within 200ms" requirement. Flag as D7 if no boundary test exists.

   d. **Ordering and timing constraints**: If the requirement specifies
      a sequence ("MUST X before Y", "only after Z completes"), verify
      that the test enforces the ordering — not just that both X and Y
      occur. A test that checks outcomes without verifying order is a D7
      finding.

   - A test case that is *linked* but fails any of the above sub-checks
     is a D7_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_MISMATCH. In the finding, specify which
     sub-check failed (criterion-level coverage, negative case coverage,
     boundary and threshold verification, or ordering and timing
     constraints) so the remediation is actionable.

## Phase 3: Backward Traceability (Downstream → Requirements)

Check that every item in downstream documents traces back to a requirement.

1. **Design → Requirements** (skip if no design document):
   - For each design component, interface, or major decision, identify
     the originating requirement(s).
   - Flag any design element that does not trace to a REQ-ID as a
     candidate D3_ORPHANED_DESIGN_DECISION.
   - Distinguish between: (a) genuine scope creep, (b) reasonable
     architectural infrastructure (e.g., logging, monitoring) that
     supports requirements indirectly, and (c) requirements gaps.
     Report all three, but note the distinction.

2. **Validation → Requirements**:
   - For each test case (TC-NNN), verify it maps to a valid REQ-ID
     that exists in the requirements document.
   - Flag any test case with no REQ-ID mapping or with a reference
     to a nonexistent REQ-ID as D4_ORPHANED_TEST_CASE.

## Phase 4: Cross-Document Consistency

Check that shared concepts, assumptions, and constraints are consistent
across all documents.

1. **Assumption alignment**:
   - Compare assumptions stated in the requirements document against
     assumptions stated or implied in the design and validation plan.
   - Flag contradictions, unstated assumptions, and extensions as
     D5_ASSUMPTION_DRIFT.

2. **Constraint propagation**:
   - For each constraint in the requirements document, verify that:
     - The design does not violate it (D6_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION if it does).
     - The validation plan includes tests that verify it.
   - Pay special attention to non-functional constraints (performance,
     scalability, security) which are often acknowledged in design but
     not validated.

3. **Terminology consistency**:
   - Check that key terms are used consistently across documents.
   - Flag cases where the same concept uses different names in different
     documents, or where the same term means different things.

4. **Scope alignment**:
   - Compare the scope sections (or equivalent) across all documents.
   - Flag items that are in scope in one document but out of scope
     (or unmentioned) in another.

## Phase 5: Classification and Reporting

Classify every finding using the specification-drift taxonomy.

1. Assign exactly one drift label (D1–D7) to each finding.
2. Assign severity using the taxonomy's severity guidance.
3. For each finding, provide:
   - The drift label and short title
   - The specific location in each relevant document (section, ID, line)
   - Evidence (what is present, what is absent, what conflicts)
   - Impact (what could go wrong if this drift is not resolved)
   - Recommended resolution
4. Order findings primarily by severity (Critical, then High, then
   Medium, then Low). Within each severity tier, order by the taxonomy's
   ranking criteria (D6/D7 first, then D2/D5, then D1/D3, then D4).

## Phase 6: Coverage Summary

After reporting individual findings, produce aggregate metrics:

1. **Forward traceability rate**: % of REQ-IDs traced to design,
   % traced to test cases.
2. **Backward traceability rate**: % of design elements traced to
   requirements, % of test cases traced to requirements.
3. **Acceptance criteria coverage**: % of acceptance criteria with
   corresponding test verification. Break down by sub-check
   (report each as N/M = %):
   - Criterion-level: individual acceptance criteria exercised / total
   - Negative case coverage: MUST NOT requirements with negative
     tests / total MUST NOT requirements
   - Boundary and threshold verification: threshold requirements with
     boundary tests / total threshold requirements
   - Ordering and timing constraints: sequence-constraint requirements
     with order-enforcing tests / total sequence-constraint requirements
4. **Assumption consistency**: count of aligned vs. conflicting vs.
   unstated assumptions.
5. **External references**: list any specifications referenced by the
   core documents that were not provided for audit. For each, note
   which requirements or design sections reference it and what coverage
   gap results from its absence.
6. **Overall assessment**: a summary judgment of specification integrity
   (e.g., "High confidence — 2 minor gaps" or "Low confidence —
   systemic traceability failures across all three documents").
