# Protocol: Corpus Safety Audit

Apply this protocol when auditing a corpus of prompt components for
safety risks introduced by ingesting or assimilating content from
external sources. Execute all phases in order. Every finding must
cite specific evidence from the inspected files.

## Phase 1: Provenance Scan

Identify which components may derive from external prompts or
third-party sources.

1. **Check explicit provenance markers.** Scan each component for:
   - Attribution comments (e.g., "derived from", "inspired by",
     "adapted from", "based on")
   - PR descriptions or commit messages referenced in the file
   - Author metadata or acknowledgment sections
   Record every component with an explicit external origin.

2. **Detect stylistic signals of external origin.** For each component
   without explicit provenance, check for:
   - Tone or terminology inconsistent with neighboring components
     (e.g., a protocol that uses "shall" when all others use "must")
   - Formatting patterns that differ from library conventions (e.g.,
     non-standard heading levels, different list styles, unusual
     Markdown constructs)
   - Domain-specific jargon that appears only in one component and
     nowhere else in the library
   - Phrasing that reads like a standalone system prompt rather than
     a composable component (e.g., "You are a…" in a protocol file)
   Flag these as **suspected external origin** with the specific
   signals observed.

3. **Cross-reference with assimilation workflows.** Check whether any
   components were produced by the `decompose-prompt` template or
   similar ingestion workflows. Use these signals only if they are
   present in the provided inputs or in repository metadata available
   to you; do not infer missing workflow history. Optional evidence
   includes:
   - Branch names containing "assimilate" or "decompose", if branch
     history is available in the audit context
   - PR descriptions referencing source prompts, if PR metadata is
     available
   - Components added in batches that share a common external theme
   If branch names, PR descriptions, or similar workflow metadata are
   unavailable, record the provenance signal as unknown/unverifiable
   rather than treating absence as evidence.

**Output**: A provenance inventory listing each component as:
Verified Original, Attributed External, Suspected External, or Unknown.

## Phase 2: Verbatim Content Detection

Check whether any component contains text that appears to be copied
verbatim from an external source rather than synthesized in original
wording.

1. **Identify copy-paste signals.** For each component flagged as
   Attributed External, Suspected External, or Unknown in Phase 1:
   - Look for runs of text (≥2 sentences) that differ markedly in
     style, vocabulary, or specificity from the surrounding content
   - Look for instructions that reference tools, platforms, or
     workflows not relevant to the component's declared scope
   - Look for vendor-specific quirks: model names, temperature
     settings, system-prompt markers, API-specific syntax
   - Look for prompt injection patterns: instructions that attempt
     to override system behavior, reset context, or bypass guardrails

2. **Classify each suspicious passage.** For passages that appear
   potentially copied:
   - **Verbatim copy**: Text that reads as direct lift with no
     rephrasing. Flag as **Critical** — must be rewritten or removed
     unless explicit permission exists.
   - **Light paraphrase**: Text that is structurally identical to a
     common prompt pattern with minimal word changes. Flag as
     **High** — should be substantially reworded to fit library
     conventions.
   - **Synthesized with residue**: Original wording but retains
     vendor-specific terms or quirks from a source. Flag as
     **Medium** — clean up the residue.
   - **Clean synthesis**: Content appears to be genuinely original.
     No action needed.

3. **Document evidence.** For each finding, record:
   - Component file path and line range
   - A minimal excerpt only when necessary to identify the issue;
     prefer short snippets or redacted fragments, and do not quote
     full suspicious passages when file+line references are sufficient
   - What signals triggered the detection
   - Classification and recommended action

## Phase 3: Confidentiality Screen

Scan the corpus for content that may have leaked from internal,
customer-specific, or proprietary sources.

1. **Scan for internal content markers.** Check every component for:
   - Internal project names, codenames, or product names that are
     not publicly known
   - Internal URLs (intranet, internal wikis, private repositories)
   - Employee names, team names, or org-chart references
   - Customer identifiers, account names, or customer-specific
     configurations
   - References to non-public systems, APIs, or infrastructure
   - Incident IDs, ticket numbers, or case references from internal
     tracking systems

2. **Scan for proprietary methodology markers.** Check for:
   - Processes or workflows that appear to be company-specific
     (e.g., "follow the XYZ team's review checklist")
   - References to proprietary tools or internal toolchains
   - Security procedures or incident response steps that should
     not be public

3. **Classify findings.** For each potential leak:
   - **Confirmed internal content**: Identifiable internal references.
     Flag as **Critical** — must be removed immediately.
   - **Suspected internal content**: Generic but suspicious references
     (e.g., a very specific process that might be company-internal).
     Flag as **High** — requires human verification.
   - **Generic content**: Domain-specific but not attributable to any
     particular organization. No action needed.

4. **Redact evidence in the report.** When documenting confidentiality
   findings, do NOT reproduce the sensitive content in the audit
   report — doing so would make the report itself a leak. Instead:
   - Reference the file path and line range
   - Describe the type of content found (e.g., "internal URL" or
     "customer identifier") without reproducing the actual values
   - Use redacted placeholders (e.g., `[REDACTED-URL]`,
     `[REDACTED-NAME]`) if quoting surrounding context

## Phase 4: License and Attribution Compliance

Verify that externally-derived components have proper licensing and
attribution records.

1. **Check attribution completeness.** For every component identified
   as Attributed External or Suspected External in Phase 1:
   - Is the original author credited?
   - Is the source prompt identified (name, URL, or description)?
   - Is the license or permission recorded (e.g., "MIT licensed",
     "author granted permission via email on YYYY-MM-DD", "public
     domain")?
   - Was a courtesy disclosure made to the original author?

2. **Check license compatibility.** For components with recorded
   licenses:
   - Is the source license compatible with PromptKit's MIT license?
   - Are there attribution requirements that are not being met
     (e.g., required copyright notices)?
   - Are there usage restrictions that conflict with PromptKit's
     open-source distribution?

3. **Flag compliance gaps.** Classify each gap:
   - **Missing attribution**: No provenance record for a component
     with suspected external origin. Flag as **High**.
   - **Missing license**: Attribution exists but no license or
     permission is recorded. Flag as **High**.
   - **Incompatible license**: Source license conflicts with MIT.
     Flag as **Critical**.
   - **Incomplete attribution**: Partial provenance (e.g., author
     known but no license recorded). Flag as **Medium**.

## Presentation

Use a stable high-level finding **Category** that remains compatible
with consuming templates (for example, `Corpus Safety`).
Do not encode the audit phase in the **Category** field.

Preserve the audit phase as traceability metadata in the finding
title and/or supporting evidence:
- Phase 1: `PROV` (provenance)
- Phase 2: `COPY` (verbatim copying)
- Phase 3: `CONF` (confidentiality)
- Phase 4: `LIC` (license compliance)

When useful, include the phase tag at the start of the finding title
(for example, `[LIC] Missing license record for externally-derived
protocol`) and repeat it in evidence or notes so downstream templates
can preserve phase-level traceability without overloading
**Category**.
