# Task: Code Review

You are tasked with performing a thorough **code review** of the
following code.

## Inputs

**Code**:
```{{language}}
{{code}}
```

**Language**: {{language}}

**Review Focus**: {{review_focus}}

**Context**: {{context}}

**Additional Protocols to Apply**: {{additional_protocols}}

## Instructions

1. **Apply the anti-hallucination protocol.** Base your review ONLY on the
   code provided. Do not assume behaviors that are not visible in the code.

2. **If additional protocols are specified** (e.g., `memory-safety-c`,
   `thread-safety`), apply them systematically in addition to the
   general review below.

3. **General review — execute all applicable checks**:

   ### Correctness
   - Does the code do what it claims to do?
   - Are edge cases handled? For each boundary condition (null, empty,
     boundary values, overflow), verify that the code has explicit,
     documented handling: either a defined non-error behavior (e.g.,
     returning an empty result, applying a default, or clamping) or,
     if the condition should be rejected, an explicit check, error
     handling, and a specific error response
   - Are error paths correct — do they clean up resources, propagate errors
     appropriately, and avoid leaving the system in an inconsistent state?
   - Are return values checked where they should be?

   ### Safety
   - Are there memory safety issues (if applicable to the language)?
   - Are there concurrency issues (data races, deadlocks)?
   - Are there resource leaks (file handles, connections, memory)?

   ### Security
   - Is input validated before use in sensitive operations?
   - Are there injection risks (SQL, command, path traversal)?
   - Are secrets or credentials handled appropriately?
   - Are error messages revealing internal details?

   ### Maintainability
   - Is the code clear and readable?
   - Are abstractions appropriate (not too much, not too little)?
   - Are there obvious violations of SOLID, DRY, or other design principles?
   - Is error handling consistent with the codebase's conventions?

4. **Format each finding as**:

   ```
   [SEVERITY: Critical|High|Medium|Low|Nit]
   Location: <file>:<line> or <function>
   Issue: <concise description>
   Evidence: <code snippet or reasoning>
   Suggestion: <specific fix or improvement>
   ```

5. **Summarize** at the end:
   - Total findings by severity
   - Overall assessment (approve / approve with changes / request changes)
   - Top 3 findings ranked by: (1) highest severity first,
     (2) for equal severity, user-visible or external API findings
     rank above internal-only, (3) if still tied, findings affecting
     more distinct functions or modules rank higher

## Non-Goals

- Do NOT refactor the code — focus on identifying issues.
- Do NOT review code outside the provided scope unless it is
  directly called by or calls into the reviewed code.
- Do NOT comment on personal style preferences — focus on
  correctness, safety, security, and maintainability.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Every finding cites a specific code location
- [ ] Every finding has a severity rating (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Nit)
- [ ] Every finding includes a concrete fix suggestion
- [ ] Findings are ordered by severity
- [ ] At least 3 findings have been re-verified against the source
- [ ] Overall assessment (approve / approve with changes / request changes) is stated
- [ ] Top 3 highest-severity items are identified in the summary
