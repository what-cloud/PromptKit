# Task: Author Agent Instruction Files

You are tasked with assembling PromptKit components into persistent agent
instruction files for the specified platform(s). For GitHub Copilot, you
will produce **composable skill files** — one per logical concern — that
the runtime loads and combines automatically. The output will be
version-controlled and automatically loaded by the agent runtime.

## Inputs

**Platform(s)**: {{platform}}

**Base Persona**: {{base_persona}}

**Protocols to encode**: {{selected_protocols}}

**Behaviors**: {{behaviors}}

**Scope**: {{scope}}

**Additional Context**: {{context}}

## Instructions

### Step 1: Load and Understand the Components

1. **Read the base persona** from `personas/{{base_persona}}.md` (or define a
   custom persona inline if `{{base_persona}}` is `custom`).
   - If custom, ask the user to describe the domain, expertise areas, tone,
     and behavioral constraints before proceeding.

2. **Read each protocol** listed in `{{selected_protocols}}`:
   - Locate the file under `protocols/` using the manifest.
   - Understand what each protocol enforces and how it interacts with the persona.
   - Note the protocol's category (`guardrails/`, `analysis/`, `reasoning/`)
     and any language specificity — these determine `applyTo` targeting.

3. **Understand the target platform(s)**:
   - Review the Platform Reference in the `agent-instructions` format spec.
   - Note any size constraints or syntax restrictions that apply.

### Step 2: Plan the Skill Decomposition (GitHub Copilot)

For GitHub Copilot output, determine how to split the content into
composable skill files. The recommended decomposition:

1. **Persona + guardrails skill** — One file containing:
   - Condensed persona identity (3–8 sentences)
   - All guardrail protocols (anti-hallucination, self-verification,
     operational-constraints)
   - `applyTo: '**'` (applies to all files)
   - Filename: `<persona-name>.instructions.md`

2. **One skill file per analysis/reasoning protocol** — Each containing:
   - The protocol's phases and checks as standing directives
   - `applyTo` set to the protocol's natural scope:
     - Language-specific → `**/*.c, **/*.h` (or appropriate extensions)
     - Domain-specific → relevant path patterns
     - General → `**`
   - Filename: `<protocol-name>.instructions.md`

3. **Project context skill** *(optional, if `{{context}}` is non-empty)* —
   - Project-specific conventions, tech stack, team preferences
   - `applyTo: '**'`
   - Filename: `project-context.instructions.md`

For Claude Code and Cursor, combine all content into a single file (these
platforms do not support per-file skill targeting).

### Step 3: Condense and Adapt the Content

Transform the loaded components into agent instruction prose:

1. **Condense the persona** into a compact identity statement (3–8 sentences):
   - Who the agent is and what domain expertise it has
   - Core behavioral stance (how it reasons, what it refuses to do)
   - How it handles uncertainty

2. **Condense each protocol** into standing directives:
   - Preserve all specific checks and phase steps from the protocol
   - Omit meta-commentary about the protocol's structure
   - Rewrite in second person ("When you encounter X, always Y")
   - If multiple protocols overlap, merge the redundant parts

3. **Incorporate the additional behaviors** from `{{behaviors}}`:
   - Add any domain-specific or project-specific instructions
   - Ensure they do not conflict with the persona or protocol directives

4. **Incorporate the project context** from `{{context}}`:
   - Include tech stack, conventions, or constraints

5. **Check for conflicts**:
   - Verify no two directives contradict each other
   - If a conflict is found, resolve it in favor of the more conservative/safe
     directive and note the resolution

### Step 4: Apply Platform Constraints

For each target platform, adapt the content:

1. **GitHub Copilot** (`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`):
   - Each skill file targets ~1–4 KB
   - Total combined instructions should stay under ~8 KB
   - Each file has YAML frontmatter with `description` and `applyTo`
   - Use plain Markdown with clear headings and bullets

2. **Claude Code** (`CLAUDE.md`):
   - No strict size limit — prefer completeness over brevity
   - Use clear Markdown structure; Claude Code reads the full file

3. **Cursor** (`.cursorrules`):
   - Target under 2 KB; omit extended examples and rationale
   - Keep directives short and imperative
   - Note any omitted content in a comment at the end of the file

4. **All platforms** (when `{{platform}}` is `All`):
   - Produce skill files for GitHub Copilot AND a combined file each for
     Claude Code and Cursor
   - Apply each platform's constraints independently
   - Note differences between variants in the Platform Notes section

### Step 5: Produce the Output Files

Following the `agent-instructions` format specification:

1. **Write the file manifest** listing every file to be created with its
   path, `applyTo` scope (for Copilot), and purpose.

2. **Write each GitHub Copilot skill file** with proper frontmatter:

       ---
       description: '<one-line summary>'
       applyTo: '<glob pattern>'
       ---
       <!-- Generated by PromptKit — edit with care -->

       <instruction content>

3. **Write combined files** for Claude Code / Cursor (if targeted):
   - Open with `<!-- Generated by PromptKit — edit with care -->`
   - Include all persona, protocol, behavior, and context content

4. **Write the Platform Notes** section covering how each file is loaded.

5. **Write the Activation Checklist** for each platform.

### Step 6: Verify the Output

Apply the `self-verification` protocol:

1. **Content completeness**: Every component from Step 1 is represented
   in at least one output file (verify each persona attribute, each
   protocol phase).

2. **Platform compliance**:
   - Copilot skill files have valid YAML frontmatter with `description`
     and `applyTo`
   - Filenames are lowercase, hyphen-separated, ending in `.instructions.md`
   - Content size is within platform guidance per file
   - No PromptKit-internal headers appear in generated file content

3. **Skill composability**: Each Copilot skill file is self-contained and
   makes sense when loaded independently or in combination.

4. **Directive consistency**: No contradictory instructions exist within
   or across skill files.

5. **Actionability**: All instructions are specific and actionable — no
   vague guidance like "be careful" or "think deeply".

6. **No placeholders**: All `{{param}}` references are resolved; no
   unsubstituted placeholders remain in any output file.

## Non-Goals

- Do NOT produce a raw PromptKit-assembled prompt (that is the bootstrap's
  default behavior). This template produces **persistent instruction files**.
- Do NOT implement new functionality — only encode existing PromptKit
  component content into platform-appropriate format.
- Do NOT generate application code, pipeline YAML, or documents as part
  of this output. Those are produced by other templates.
- Do NOT include the PromptKit assembly process itself in the output files —
  the agent runtime loading the file does not need to know about PromptKit.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Copilot files have valid YAML frontmatter (`description`, `applyTo`)
- [ ] Filenames are lowercase, hyphen-separated, ending in `.instructions.md`
- [ ] `applyTo` globs match the protocol's natural scope
- [ ] Each skill file is self-contained and independently coherent
- [ ] No PromptKit-internal section headers appear in any output file
- [ ] All `{{param}}` placeholders are resolved
- [ ] Content size is within platform guidance for each file
- [ ] Persona identity is clearly stated in the persona skill file
- [ ] Every protocol phase is represented as a standing directive
- [ ] No contradictory directives exist within or across files
- [ ] Platform Notes and Activation Checklist are complete
- [ ] Output is ready to commit without further editing
