# Task: Author Implementation Prompt

You are tasked with producing a **structured prompt** that a coding
agent will consume to generate implementation code. The output is a
prompt document — you do NOT write code yourself.

## Inputs

**Project Name**: {{project_name}}

**Requirements Document**:
{{requirements_doc}}

**Design Document** (if provided — ignore if "None"):
{{design_doc}}

**Target Language**: {{language}}

**Conventions**: {{conventions}}

**Focus Areas**: {{focus_areas}}

**Audience**: {{audience}}

## Instructions

1. **Extract implementable requirements.** From the requirements
   document (and design document if provided), identify every
   requirement that translates to code. Group by module or functional
   area.

2. **For each requirement**, produce a coding instruction that includes:
   - The REQ-ID and requirement text
   - The acceptance criteria (what "done" looks like)
   - Constraints to enforce in code (performance, security, validation)
   - Error handling expectations (what happens on invalid input, failure)
   - A traceability instruction: "Include a comment using the
     language-appropriate syntax referencing the exact REQ-ID (e.g.,
     `# Implements REQ-AUTH-003` in Python, `// Implements REQ-AUTH-003`
     in Rust/Java/C) at the implementation site"

3. **Include language-specific guidance.** Using the target language
   and conventions provided:
   - Specify idiomatic patterns for the language
   - Specify error handling style (exceptions, Result types, error
     codes)
   - Specify naming conventions (snake_case, camelCase, etc.)
   - Specify module/file organization expectations

4. **Include constraint enforcement instructions.** For each
   constraint in the requirements:
   - Specify how to enforce it in code (assertion, validation,
     timeout, check)
   - Specify what to do when the constraint is violated (error,
     rejection, fallback)

5. **Specify exclusions** for the "Out of Scope" section. List
   behaviors that are explicitly excluded — requirements not in the
   focus area, features not in the spec, optimizations not required.
   This prevents the coding agent from adding undocumented behavior.

6. **Format the output** according to the requirements-doc format.
   Place non-goals under section "2.2 Out of Scope" per the format's
   structure.

7. **Quality checklist** — before finalizing, verify:
   - [ ] Every REQ-ID from the input requirements appears in the
         coding brief (or is documented as out of scope)
   - [ ] Every requirement includes its acceptance criteria
   - [ ] Every constraint has an enforcement instruction
   - [ ] Traceability instructions are included (REQ-ID in comments)
   - [ ] Language-specific conventions are specified
   - [ ] An "Out of Scope" section exists under Scope
   - [ ] The output is consumable by the target audience (coding agent)

## Non-Goals

- Do NOT write implementation code — produce the prompt only.
- Do NOT make design decisions not in the spec — if the design doc
  doesn't specify an approach, flag it as a decision the implementer
  must make.
- Do NOT provide implementation instructions for requirements outside
  the focus areas — list them under Out of Scope instead.
- Do NOT generate test code — that is the job of `author-test-prompt`.
