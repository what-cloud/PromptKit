# Taxonomy: CWE Native User-Mode C/C++

This taxonomy contains 172 CWE weakness classes applicable to
User-mode native applications in C/C++. Derived from CWE version 4.19.1.

When performing a security audit scoped to the `native-user-mode-c-cpp` domain,
**only** consider CWE IDs listed in this taxonomy. If you find something
plausible outside this subset, record it as `out-of-scope candidate`
with the CWE ID — do not expand scope.
