# Taxonomy: CWE Cryptographic Protocols

This taxonomy contains 63 CWE weakness classes applicable to
Cryptographic protocol design and implementation. Derived from CWE version 4.19.1.

When performing a security audit scoped to the `crypto-protocols` domain,
**only** consider CWE IDs listed in this taxonomy. If you find something
plausible outside this subset, record it as `out-of-scope candidate`
with the CWE ID — do not expand scope.

**Abstraction**: Class

**Detection Hints**: No specific detection method documented in CWE.

### CWE-636: Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open')

When the product encounters an error condition or failure, its design requires it to fall back to a state that is less secure than other options that are available, such as selecting the weakest encryption algorithm or using the most permissive access control restrictions.

**Abstraction**: Class

**Detection Hints**: No specific detection method documented in CWE.

### CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
