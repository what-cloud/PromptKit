# Taxonomy: CWE Managed .NET

This taxonomy contains 92 CWE weakness classes applicable to
.NET managed code (C#, F#, VB.NET). Derived from CWE version 4.19.1.

When performing a security audit scoped to the `managed-dotnet` domain,
**only** consider CWE IDs listed in this taxonomy. If you find something
plausible outside this subset, record it as `out-of-scope candidate`
with the CWE ID — do not expand scope.
