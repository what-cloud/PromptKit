# Taxonomy: CWE Data Processing

This taxonomy contains 69 CWE weakness classes applicable to
Data pipelines, ETL, batch processing. Derived from CWE version 4.19.1.

When performing a security audit scoped to the `data-processing` domain,
**only** consider CWE IDs listed in this taxonomy. If you find something
plausible outside this subset, record it as `out-of-scope candidate`
with the CWE ID — do not expand scope.
