# Taxonomy: CWE Mobile Applications

This taxonomy contains 23 CWE weakness classes applicable to
Mobile applications (iOS, Android). Derived from CWE version 4.19.1.

When performing a security audit scoped to the `mobile-app` domain,
**only** consider CWE IDs listed in this taxonomy. If you find something
plausible outside this subset, record it as `out-of-scope candidate`
with the CWE ID — do not expand scope.

## Classes

### CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information

The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: Automated Static Analysis (High)

### CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: Black Box; Automated Static Analysis (High)

### CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor

The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: Architecture or Design Review (High); Automated Static Analysis (High); Automated Static Analysis

### CWE-511: Logic/Time Bomb

The product contains code that is designed to disrupt the legitimate operation of the product (or its environment) when a certain time passes, or when a certain logical condition is met.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: Automated Static Analysis

### CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime

The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: Automated Static Analysis (High)

### CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials

The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Abstraction**: Base

### CWE-920: Improper Restriction of Power Consumption

The product operates in an environment in which power is a limited resource that cannot be automatically replenished, but the product does not properly restrict the amount of power that its operation consumes.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: No specific detection method documented in CWE.

### CWE-921: Storage of Sensitive Data in a Mechanism without Access Control

The product stores sensitive information in a file system or device that does not have built-in access control.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: No specific detection method documented in CWE.

### CWE-939: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme

The product uses a handler for a custom URL scheme, but it does not properly restrict which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: Automated Static Analysis

### CWE-940: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel

The product establishes a communication channel to handle an incoming request that has been initiated by an actor, but it does not properly verify that the request is coming from the expected origin.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: No specific detection method documented in CWE.

### CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel

The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: No specific detection method documented in CWE.

### CWE-1256: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features

The product provides software-controllable device functionality for capabilities such as power and clock management, but it does not properly limit functionality that can lead to modification of hardware memory or register bits, or the ability to observe physical side channels.

**Abstraction**: Base

**Detection Hints**: Manual Analysis; Automated Dynamic Analysis (Moderate)

### CWE-1420: Exposure of Sensitive Information during Transient Execution

A processor event or prediction may allow incorrect operations (or correct operations with incorrect data) to execute transiently, potentially exposing data over a covert channel.
