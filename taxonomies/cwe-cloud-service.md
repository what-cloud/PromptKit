# Taxonomy: CWE Cloud Service

This taxonomy contains 113 CWE weakness classes applicable to
Cloud-hosted services and APIs. Derived from CWE version 4.19.1.

When performing a security audit scoped to the `cloud-service` domain,
**only** consider CWE IDs listed in this taxonomy. If you find something
plausible outside this subset, record it as `out-of-scope candidate`
with the CWE ID — do not expand scope.
