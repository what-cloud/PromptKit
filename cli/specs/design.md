## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Module Structure

The CLI consists of two runtime modules and one build-time script:

```
cli/
├── bin/
│   └── cli.js            # Entry point — command routing (Commander.js)
├── lib/
│   └── launch.js         # LLM CLI detection & interactive session launch
├── scripts/
│   └── copy-content.js   # Build-time content bundler (npm lifecycle)
├── content/              # [gitignored] Bundled PromptKit components
│   ├── manifest.yaml
│   ├── bootstrap.md
│   ├── personas/
│   ├── protocols/
│   ├── formats/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── taxonomies/
└── package.json
```

### 1.2 Dependency Graph (Runtime)

```
cli.js
├── commander           (external: CLI framework)
├── js-yaml             (external: YAML parsing for list command)
└── lib/launch.js
    └── child_process   (Node built-in)
```

All non-`commander`/`js-yaml` imports are Node.js built-ins: `fs`, `path`,
`os`, `child_process`.

### 1.3 Command Flow

```
User invokes `promptkit [command]`
          │
          ▼
   ┌─────────────┐
   │   cli.js     │──── ensureContent() ──── Content missing? → exit(1)
   │  (Commander) │     (checks bootstrap.md AND manifest.yaml)
   └──────┬───────┘
          │
    ┌─────┴─────┐
    ▼           ▼
interactive   list
    │           │
    │      read manifest.yaml (js-yaml)
    │      flatten templates by category
    │      display (human or --json)
    │
    ├── detectCli()
    ├── copyContentToTemp()
    └── spawn(cli, args, {cwd: tmpDir})
         │
         └── on exit: cleanup tmpDir, propagate exit code
```

## 2. Module Design

### 2.1 cli.js — Command Routing

**Responsibility**: Parse CLI arguments, route to the correct handler,
validate content availability.

**Design decisions**:
- Uses Commander.js (^12.0.0) for argument parsing — it is the de facto
  standard for Node.js CLIs, providing built-in help generation, version
  display, and subcommand support.
- The `interactive` command is marked `{ isDefault: true }` so bare
  `promptkit` invocations launch interactive mode.
- `ensureContent()` is called in every command's action handler (not
  globally) to ensure the check runs after Commander has parsed arguments.
  The check validates both `bootstrap.md` and `manifest.yaml` exist.
- The `list` command performs inline manifest parsing using `js-yaml` —
  it reads `manifest.yaml`, flattens the nested `templates` structure
  by category, and displays the result. No separate `manifest.js` module
  is used (see REQ-CLI-103).
- The `--cli` flag documents valid values (`copilot`, `gh-copilot`,
  `claude`) in its help text (see REQ-CLI-011).

**Key function**:

```
ensureContent() → void | process.exit(1)
```
Checks for both `bootstrap.md` and `manifest.yaml` in the content
directory. Guards all commands.

**Implements**: REQ-CLI-001 through REQ-CLI-004, REQ-CLI-020 through
REQ-CLI-023, REQ-CLI-100, REQ-CLI-103.

### 2.2 assemble.js — Assembly Engine [RETIRED]

*This module has been removed. The assembly engine was redundant with
the Assembly Process defined in `bootstrap.md`. The LLM performs all
prompt assembly. See REQ-CLI-101.*

*Previously implemented*: REQ-CLI-040 through REQ-CLI-051 (all retired).

### 2.3 manifest.js — Manifest Parsing & Dependency Resolution [RETIRED]

*This module has been removed. The LLM reads `manifest.yaml` directly
when following `bootstrap.md`. The `list` command's manifest parsing
is inlined in `cli.js`. See REQ-CLI-101, REQ-CLI-103.*

*Previously implemented*: REQ-CLI-060 through REQ-CLI-069 (all retired).

### 2.4 launch.js — LLM CLI Detection & Interactive Launch

**Responsibility**: Detect LLM CLIs on PATH, stage content, and spawn an
interactive session.

**Design decisions**:
- CLI detection uses `execFileSync` with `where` (Windows) or `which`
  (Unix) — this is the most reliable cross-platform way to check if a
  command exists on PATH without actually executing it.
- The detection order (copilot → gh-copilot → claude) prioritizes GitHub
  Copilot CLI as the primary target. The `gh copilot` variant is checked
  by actually running `gh copilot --help` to verify the extension is
  installed, not just that `gh` exists.
- Content is copied to a temp directory (`os.tmpdir()` + `mkdtempSync`)
  because LLM CLIs need to read the files from their CWD, and the npm
  package's `content/` directory may be in a read-only or non-obvious
  location. The temp directory approach ensures the LLM has a clean
  working directory with all content files.
- The child process is spawned with `stdio: "inherit"` so the user
  interacts directly with the LLM CLI. The parent Node.js process becomes
  a thin lifecycle manager.
- Signal forwarding on child exit (`process.kill(process.pid, signal)`)
  preserves the child's exit semantics for the parent's caller.
- Temp directory cleanup is wrapped in try/catch for best-effort cleanup —
  if deletion fails (e.g., file locks on Windows), the OS temp cleaner
  will eventually remove it.
- The "no CLI found" error message lists LLM CLI installation
  instructions and suggests manual loading of `bootstrap.md`. It does
  NOT reference a `promptkit assemble` fallback (see REQ-CLI-012).

**Key functions**:

```
isOnPath(cmd: string) → boolean
```
Internal helper. Checks if a command exists on PATH using platform-
appropriate lookup.

```
detectCli() → "copilot" | "gh-copilot" | "claude" | null
```
Probes PATH for supported LLM CLIs in priority order.

```
copyContentToTemp(contentDir: string) → string
```
Copies entire content directory to a new temp directory. Returns the
temp directory path. Note: unlike `copy-content.js`, this copies ALL
files (no `.md`/`.yaml` filter). [INFERRED]

```
copyDirRecursive(src: string, dest: string) → void
```
Internal helper for recursive directory copy.

```
launchInteractive(contentDir: string, cliName: string | null) → void
```
Main entry point for interactive mode. Detects/validates CLI, stages
content, spawns child process, manages lifecycle. Never returns normally
— exits via `process.exit()`.

**Implements**: REQ-CLI-010 through REQ-CLI-019.

### 2.5 copy-content.js — Build-Time Content Bundler

**Responsibility**: Copy PromptKit library content from the repository
root into `cli/content/` for npm packaging.

**Design decisions**:
- Runs as an npm lifecycle script (`prepare` and `prepublishOnly`), not
  as a runtime module. This ensures content is always fresh when
  publishing or installing from source.
- Filters file copying to `.md` and `.yaml` extensions only, excluding
  images, binaries, and other non-prompt assets (e.g., `PromptKit-logo.png`).
- Uses a clean-and-recreate strategy (delete `content/`, mkdir, copy)
  to prevent stale files from previous builds.
- Path resolution uses `__dirname` to find the repo root (`../..` from
  `scripts/`), which assumes the standard repository layout.
- The count of copied entries is reported for verification.

**Implements**: REQ-CLI-070 through REQ-CLI-076.

## 3. Data Flow

### 3.1 Assembly Pipeline [RETIRED]

*This data flow has been removed. The assembly pipeline was implemented
by `assemble.js` and `manifest.js`, both of which have been deleted.
The LLM performs prompt assembly when following `bootstrap.md`.*

### 3.2 Interactive Launch Pipeline

```
     User runs `promptkit` or `promptkit interactive`
                         │
                   ensureContent()
                   (check bootstrap.md + manifest.yaml)
                         │
                   detectCli() ──── probe PATH
                         │
                   cliName || detected ──── null? → error + exit(1)
                         │
                   copyContentToTemp(contentDir)
                    │ recursive copy to os.tmpdir()
                    │ returns tmpDir path
                         │
                   construct cmd + args for detected CLI
                         │
                   spawn(cmd, args, {cwd: tmpDir, stdio: "inherit"})
                         │
                    ┌─────┴─────┐
                    │           │
                 on error    on exit
                    │           │
                 cleanup     cleanup tmpDir
                 tmpDir      exit(child.code) or
                 exit(1)     re-signal(child.signal)
```

### 3.3 List Pipeline

```
     User runs `promptkit list [--json]`
                         │
                   ensureContent()
                   (check bootstrap.md + manifest.yaml)
                         │
                   read manifest.yaml (fs.readFileSync)
                   parse with js-yaml
                         │
                   flatten templates by category
                   (iterate manifest.templates keys,
                    spread each item + add category field)
                         │
                    ┌─────┴─────┐
                    │           │
                 --json?     human-readable
                    │           │
                 JSON.stringify  group by category
                 → stdout       print headers + names
                                print usage hint
```

### 3.4 Content Bundling Pipeline (build-time)

```
     npm publish / npm install (from git)
                    │
          triggers `prepare` or `prepublishOnly`
                    │
          node scripts/copy-content.js
                    │
          validate manifest.yaml at repo root
                    │
          rm -rf cli/content/ && mkdir cli/content/
                    │
     ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
     │              │              │
  copy files     copy dirs     (filter .md/.yaml)
  manifest.yaml  personas/
  bootstrap.md   protocols/
                 formats/
                 templates/
                 taxonomies/
                    │
          report count
```

## 4. Key Design Decisions

### 4.1 Commander.js for CLI Framework

**Decision**: Use Commander.js (^12.0.0) for argument parsing.
**Rationale**: Industry standard for Node.js CLIs. Provides automatic help
generation, version flags, subcommand support, and repeatable options out
of the box. Zero-config for the CLI's two-command structure.
**Alternatives considered**: yargs, meow, manual `process.argv` parsing.
Commander was chosen for its simplicity and convention-over-configuration
approach. [INFERRED]

### 4.2 js-yaml for YAML Parsing

**Decision**: Use js-yaml (^4.1.0) for parsing `manifest.yaml` in the
`list` command.
**Rationale**: Pure JavaScript, no native dependencies, YAML 1.2 compliant.
The manifest is the only YAML the CLI parses at runtime — it is read
inline by the `list` command in `cli.js` (no separate module).

### 4.3 Temp Directory for Interactive Launch

**Decision**: Copy all content to `os.tmpdir()` before spawning the LLM CLI.
**Rationale**: LLM CLIs read files relative to their CWD. The npm package
installs content in an unpredictable location (`node_modules/`). Copying
to a temp directory gives the LLM a clean, predictable file layout.
**Tradeoff**: Adds startup latency (recursive copy) and creates cleanup
obligations.

### 4.4 Inline Manifest Parsing for List Command

**Decision**: Parse `manifest.yaml` directly in `cli.js` rather than using
a separate `manifest.js` module.
**Rationale**: The `list` command only needs to read and flatten the
templates section of the manifest. This is ~10 lines of code (read file,
parse YAML, iterate categories, flatten). A separate module introduced
unnecessary abstraction and coupling — `manifest.js` also contained
dependency resolution functions (`getPersona`, `getProtocol`, etc.) that
are no longer needed since `assemble.js` has been removed. Inlining keeps
the code minimal and eliminates the module dependency.
**Tradeoff**: If manifest parsing logic grows in the future, it may need
to be extracted into a module. Currently, the inline approach is
proportionate to the complexity.

### 4.5 Build-Time Content Bundling

**Decision**: Use npm lifecycle scripts to bundle content rather than
referencing the repo root at runtime.
**Rationale**: npm packages cannot reference files outside their package
directory. Content must be physically included in the package. The
`prepare` hook ensures this works for both `npm publish` and
`npm install` from git.

### 4.6 LLM as Single Source of Truth for Assembly

**Decision**: Remove the CLI's assembly engine and delegate all prompt
assembly to the LLM via `bootstrap.md`.
**Rationale**: The CLI's `assemble.js` reimplemented the Assembly Process
from `bootstrap.md`, creating two implementations of the same logic that
had already diverged (bug #137). The CLI assembly could not handle
interactive templates, parameterized personas, dynamic protocols, or
Non-Goals sections — features the LLM handles naturally. Removing the
redundant implementation eliminates an entire class of maintenance burden
and divergence risk. The LLM is the single source of truth for assembly.
**Tradeoff**: Loss of deterministic, offline, no-LLM assembly for
CI/scripting use cases. Users without an LLM CLI can manually read and
assemble from the Markdown files.

## 5. Interface Contracts

### 5.1 CLI Interface (User-Facing)

```
promptkit [command] [options]

Commands:
  interactive [--cli <name>]           Launch interactive LLM session (default)
  list [--json]                        List available templates

Global options:
  -V, --version                        Output version number
  -h, --help                           Display help

Interactive options:
  --cli <name>      Override LLM CLI auto-detection
                    Valid values: copilot, gh-copilot, claude
```

### 5.2 Module Exports

**launch.js**:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  detectCli,          // () → "copilot" | "gh-copilot" | "claude" | null
  launchInteractive,  // (contentDir: string, cliName: string | null) → never
  copyContentToTemp   // (contentDir: string) → string (tmpDir path)
}
```

### 5.3 Manifest Schema (Expected Input)

The CLI expects `manifest.yaml` to conform to this structure (used by the
`list` command for template enumeration):

```yaml
version: string

templates:
  <category>:           # e.g., engineering, investigation
    - name: string
      description: string
      # ... other fields (ignored by list command)
```

The full manifest schema (including `personas`, `protocols`, `formats`,
`taxonomies`) is consumed by the LLM via `bootstrap.md`, not by the CLI.

[ASSUMPTION — this schema is inferred from code behavior; no formal
schema definition exists in the codebase]

### 5.4 Assembled Output Format [RETIRED]

*This section is retired. The CLI no longer produces assembled output.
Prompt assembly is performed by the LLM when following `bootstrap.md`.
See the Assembly Process section of `bootstrap.md` for the output format
specification.*

## 7. Known Gaps

### 7.1 Redundancy with bootstrap.md [RESOLVED]

**[RESOLVED] GAP-001: Manifest resolution logic is duplicated.**
*Resolved in v0.2: `manifest.js` has been removed. The LLM reads
`manifest.yaml` directly. The `list` command uses inline parsing.*

**[RESOLVED] GAP-002: Assembly engine is mostly redundant.**
*Resolved in v0.2: `assemble.js` has been removed. The LLM performs all
prompt assembly via `bootstrap.md`.*

### 7.2 Feature Gaps [RESOLVED or N/A]

**[RESOLVED] GAP-003: No Non-Goals section.**
*Resolved: The CLI no longer produces assembled output. The LLM includes
Non-Goals when following `bootstrap.md`.*

**[RESOLVED] GAP-004: No interactive template mode support.**
*Resolved: The CLI no longer assembles prompts. The LLM handles
interactive templates natively.*

**[RESOLVED] GAP-005: No agent instruction file output mode.**
*Resolved: The CLI no longer assembles prompts. The LLM handles all
output modes.*

**[RESOLVED] GAP-006: No manifest schema validation.**
*Resolved: The CLI no longer validates manifest structure beyond
existence checking. The LLM validates the manifest when reading it.*

**[RESOLVED] GAP-007: No pipeline support.**
*Resolved: The CLI no longer assembles prompts. The LLM handles
pipelines natively via `bootstrap.md`.*

### 7.3 Implementation Concerns

**GAP-008: copyContentToTemp copies all file types.**
`launch.js`'s `copyDirRecursive` copies every file, while
`copy-content.js` filters to `.md`/`.yaml`. If the content directory
somehow contains non-prompt files, they would be copied to temp.
[INFERRED — in practice, the content directory is populated by
`copy-content.js` which already filters, so this is low risk]

**[RESOLVED] GAP-009: Inconsistent return types for lookup functions.**
*Resolved: `manifest.js` has been removed. No lookup functions remain.*

**GAP-010: The `--cli` flag accepts undocumented values.**
Valid values for `--cli` (`copilot`, `gh-copilot`, `claude`) should be
listed in help text. This is addressed by the updated REQ-CLI-011 which
requires documenting valid values.
- *Affects*: REQ-CLI-011, ASSUMPTION-003.
- *Status*: To be resolved in implementation.

**[RESOLVED] GAP-011: Template name matching is case-sensitive and undocumented.**
*Resolved: The `assemble` command has been removed. Template name matching
is no longer a CLI concern.*
